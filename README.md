# DataCamp | Analyzing Students Mental Health (SQL)

This project is part of the **SQL Fundamentals** in Python skill track on DataCamp. Practice SQL skills such as using aggregate functions (e.g., `COUNT`, `AVG`), applying `WHERE` clauses for filtering, organizing data with `GROUP BY`, and sorting results using `ORDER BY` for effective data manipulation.
